Instructions

Welcome to your own personal GIF Search Engine.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

Under every gif, display its rating (Rated G).

This data is provided by the GIPHY API.

Use the search button to generate any GIF and watch the animations stop and start with each click.


Enjoy!
